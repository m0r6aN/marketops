# What You Are Looking At

This folder contains a cryptographically sealed proof of governed AI intent.

It demonstrates:

- Deterministic proposal generation
- Policy evaluation and denial
- Cryptographic receipt minting (Federation Core)
- Asymmetric manifest signing (Ed25519)
- Tenant-bound attribution
- Independent verification (no backend required)

Most AI systems demonstrate behavior.

MarketOps demonstrates *evidence*.

This is a governance-first execution model designed for:

- Enterprise automation
- Change-control enforcement
- Compliance-bound AI workflows
- Multi-tenant SaaS governance
- Audit-grade traceability

The included VERIFY.ps1 script independently re-derives every signature and hash from disk.

If any artifact is altered, verification fails.

This is not a demo.

It is a portable, self-verifying governance artifact.
